This is a project for the course of distributed systems in NTUA university.
It's an implementation of a theorical cryptocurrency close to the logic and axioms of bitcoin.

Spesifically, the aim of this project was to create a blockchain architecture for allowing multiple users to create transactions of a pseudo coin. Main parts of this project was the creation of a user's wallet, transaction and blockchain template, the consensus algorithms, mining process, testing and automation tools. In addition, we tested the scalability of the project between 5, 10, 20 clients and we propose small changes for fast  block chain convergence between the clients and miners, speeding up the transaction validation process, and reducing the chance of transaction loss.
